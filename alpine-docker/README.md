This directory includes Dockerfiles and auxiliary helper files used to build
Alpine Linux Docker containers which contain Linux cross-compilers used to build
release artifacts.

See `.github/workflows/` which includes workflows for building the containers
(which are hosted on ghcr.io) and building the release artifacts themselves.
